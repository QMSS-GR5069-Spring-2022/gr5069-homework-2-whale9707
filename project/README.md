# Lab Report 2 

## Objectives: 
This report will use the General Social Survey (GSS) 2006 data to do some exploratory data analysis. 

## Questions to answer:
* Qn1. Recode 1 sort of continuous variable into categories. Tell me what you did and explain the variable(s).

* Qn2. Recode 1 another variable and attach value labels. Tell me what you did and explain the variable(s).

* Qn3. Use one (or both) of your recoded variables to do a cross-tabulation (as you had done last week, with prop.table, doBy, or ddply). Explain your results.

* Qn4. Run a linear regression with 1 independent and 1 dependent variable. Make all of the recodes necessary to make the model as easy to interpret as possible. And explain your results.

* Qn5. Plot two variables, either as a scatter plot or boxplot. Explain your results.

* Qn6. Tell me two theories/ideas you might want to test in this course. Do you have a dataset for these ideas/theories already? Do you have it in R-readable format already? What is your main independent variable? What is your main dependent variable?
